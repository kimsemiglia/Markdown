Could you possibly be confusing the terms microservice and API in professional conversations? It’s more common than you would think. Though it’s understandable why one would confuse the two terms, understanding the distinction between the two would allow you to have more productive business conversations.

  

In this guide, we’ll equip you with the knowledge of what exactly an API is and what microservices are. Then we’ll talk about how the two terms are confused and how they both differ.

## What is an API?

API, or **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface, comes in many forms. When someone says API, they can be talking about anything from a private API to a public API, SOAP API to a RESTful API, which could get confusing for a non-techie. To make this guide easier to follow, we’ll talk about the kind most used in the context of microservices— Rest API. Often, rest API is what people refer to when they talk about Google Maps’ API and Twitter’s API.

  

In the context of software development, modern web apps, software architecture and integration, an API simply allows applications and services to communicate with each other by exchanging information and data.

  

A less abstract definition is that an API is a way for your application to communicate with an external service, like Google maps, through a set of commands and clearly defined methods. APIs allow you to seamlessly add specific functions that you didn’t create to your application or software.

  

Let’s use an analogy to describe an API…

  

Think about lamp creators. They don’t have to figure out how to build a power outlet nor the science of how to make it provide electricity. They simply create the lamp with the correct power cord and know that the power outlets will provide the electricity needed for their lamp to work.

  

What allows the power socket to interact with the lamp? A power cord. In the same way, an API is like a power cord. It’s the connection bit that allows the lamp to get the electricity it needs to work.

  

Now for a more concrete example…

  

Say you wanted to create an app that will benefit from having a map on it. You could build Google maps from the ground up at the expense of your time and resources. Plus, because Google maps updates their app regularly, you’d have to constantly copy it.

  

Instead, Google will abstract away all the details necessary to implement its service behind an API and provide you with that API. That way, you nor your programmer has to learn all of the specifics of Google’s code to access parts of their database. You simply place the provided API into your code, and whenever Google maps has an update, it changes on your site too.

  

Now that we’ve gotten more clear on what an API is, we’ll continue the lamp analogy in the next section as we get clear on what a microservice is.

## What are microservices?

Microservices is an architecture style that breaks up an application into smaller, independent services (usually focused around business capabilities) that generally communicate with each other via APIs. In other words, APIs connect each service to provide a fully functioning service or app.

  

With that said, let’s revisit the analogy we introduced earlier. If the power socket is an API, then both the power outlet housed with electricity and the appliance connected to it act as the microservices.

  

To further understand microservices and how it differs from an API, it’ll help to understand what came before it, monoliths.

### Monoliths vs. microservices

A monolith architecture style is the predecessor to the alternative microservice architecture style. Formerly, software programs were built in one piece, and components within the program were all interconnected or dependent on one another. This started to become a problem for companies who were growing very large, like Netflix and Amazon.

  

Let’s look at an eCommerce app to understand the main difference. With a monolith architecture, all functions are grouped and, by nature, have to use the same server, language, platform, and the like. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/df-GpaDM-Xyrg3KE5DreIOG10Yc4knE41KUssBCDIQXDWhXeStb3zpOa2LE-jOLpeoK9b7yXC_EDfynTvR7PchxAGl14p2wRVJRRqJOjj41spneXBzQjm_3P8G5elgkwWxQtRMam)

  

On the other hand, a microservice breaks a feature (or application) into task level services. This means that instead of just one big shopping cart service, there would be a billing service, shipping options service, tax calculation service and other mini services associated with a shopping cart service. Essentially, developers can break down the functionality of a monolith into smaller services that run independently from each other.

  

Perhaps the biggest advantage that microservices have over a monolith architecture is scalability. However, there are a lot more advantages to it as follows:

  

Comparing architecture styles: Monoliths vs. Microservices

-   **Language dependency**: You’re affected by decisions made in the past. For example, if the application was written in Python, future components must also be written in Python, not Java. However, it doesn’t matter with microservices because each individual service can now communicate through REST APIs. .
    
-   **New hire friendliness**: All developers must have context of all services if they want to start making changes to monoliths. Meanwhile, new developers only have to learn the context of the specific, independent service, not the entire monolith. This means new members have to train for shorter periods before getting their hands dirty.
    
-   **Remote work friendliness**: Each service is independent, so different services within one application can be worked on simultaneously and deployed separately. Developers don’t have to work on the same repository. This makes it especially useful for larger companies because it allows them to form teams to work on separate items without constantly going back and forth.
    
-   **Deployment flexibility**: The whole application has to be deployed at once. This makes it harder and longer to introduce changes because changes in the system require a build-test-release cycle for the entire codebase. This is why updates to this type of system are often limited to just a few times per year. Each mini-application is independent and deploys separately, making it easier and faster to push out changes. This makes maintenance easier.
    
-   **Documentation:** Documentation is more important with microservices because if something goes wrong, it can be very hard to determine where, if there isn’t good documentation.
    
-   **Change friendliness**: Many companies have built up a large single codebase, which means even small changes in the system require a build-test-release cycle for the entire codebase. New services can be tested easily and individually with less chance of disruption. This aspect of microservices makes it easier for a company to have quicker forward progress.
    
-   **Traffic spike responsiveness**: Let’s look at Netflix. If they had a monolith architecture, they’d have to adjust to holiday traffic spikes by scaling up the entire application. With microservices, they can instead just scale up the browse and DVD checkout function and leave the returns function alone until after the holidays.
    

  

As you might imagine, companies would be inefficient with their budget by scaling functions that don’t need to be scaled. Microservices allow them to scale up and down as they see fit.

  

Although microservices have many benefits, It’s important to stress that they're not exactly better than monoliths, as many people falsely believe. It’s just an alternative. Both offer advantages and disadvantages, depending on your specific situation.

## Differences between microservices and REST API

Now that we know more about microservices and how it differs from a monolith, let’s now address how microservices differ from APIs as most people know it.

  

Each component within software built by microservices will have its own API and use it to communicate with other components within the architecture to provide a fully functioning app. The APIs that connect components to each other serve a different purpose than the APIs you leverage to solve both you and your customer's business problems, which we’ll touch on next.

  

Microservices enable APIs. It’s similar to how a server and software enable a website. A microservice is what makes an API accessible to people. It hosts the API service and makes the security around it work so only authorised users can access the data or resources they are allowed to.

  

When you deploy a microservice, you’re deploying the architecture and code that enables the API. When the API that’s built on the microservice gets exposed by the microservice, other services can now access the API’s data and essentially use it.

  

Because microservices are language-independent, they rely on REST APIs to communicate between them and thus be able to function.

  
  

### Conclusion: Microservices and APIs

Microservices and APIs play a massive role in software development in 2021.. They’re terms you’ll be seeing a lot. This is why it’s crucial for any organization looking to harness digital capabilities within their [whole business process](https://www.ampersandtech.com/services/business-process) to know the distinction between the two.

  

They both offer a ton of benefits and by confusing the two, you’d be blind to many of their benefits individually. As stated earlier, just because microservices seem to be the hype nowadays doesn’t mean it’s right for every business quite yet. That doesn’t mean you still can’t make use of APIs to transform your business.

  

Knowing when or how to introduce microservices and how to take advantage of APIs can transform your business. APIs when used right can make for powerful integrations and new streams of revenue.
