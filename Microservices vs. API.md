Could you possibly be confusing the terms microservice and API in professional conversations? It’s more common than you would think. Though it’s understandable why one would confuse the two concepts, understanding the distinction between the two can allow you to have more productive business conversations.

  

In this guide, we’ll equip you with the knowledge of what exactly an API is and what microservices are. Then we’ll talk about how the two terms work together and differ.

## What is an API?

API, or **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface, comes in many forms. When someone says API, they can be talking about anything from a private API to a public API, or a SOAP API to a RESTful API, which could get confusing for many people. To make this guide easier to follow, we’ll talk about the kind most used in the context of microservices— REST API. Often, REST API is what people refer to when they talk about Google Maps’ API and Twitter’s API.

  

In the context of software development, modern web apps, software architecture and integration, an API simply allows applications and services to communicate with each other by exchanging information and data.

  

A more in-depth definition is that an API is a way for your application to communicate with an external service, like Google Maps, through a set of commands and clearly defined methods. APIs allow you to seamlessly add specific functions that others created to your application or software.

  

Let’s use an analogy to describe an API…

Think about lamp manufacturers. They don’t have to figure out how to build a power outlet nor learn the science of how to make it provide electricity. They simply create the lamp with the correct power cord and know that the power outlets will provide the electricity needed for their lamp to work.

  

What allows the power socket to interact with the lamp? A power cord. In the same way, an API is like a power cord. It’s the connecting part that allows the lamp to receive the electricity it needs to work.

  

Now for a more concrete example…

  

Say you wanted to create the next ride-sharing app, which requires you to utilize a map. You have a couple of options:

1.  You could build something similar to Google Maps from the ground up at the expense of your time and resources. And whenever there’s an update on the road, like significant traffic or construction, you’d have to constantly make the necessary changes yourself.
    
2.  Or you could leverage a Google Maps API. Google abstracts away all the details necessary to implement its service behind an API and provides you with that API.
    

  

The latter option makes it so that you nor your programmer has to learn all of the specifics of Google’s code to access parts of their database. You only need to place the provided API into your code, and whenever Google Maps has an update, it changes on your site too.

  

Now that we’ve gotten clearer on what an API is, we’ll continue the lamp analogy in the next section as we get clear on what a microservice is.

## What are microservices?

Microservices is an architecture style that breaks up an application into smaller, independent services or components (usually focused around business capabilities). These services generally communicate with each other via APIs. In other words, APIs connect each service within a microservices architecture to provide a fully functioning service or app. APIs, in this context, have a slightly different functionality.

  

With that said, let’s revisit the analogy we introduced earlier. If the power cord is an API, then both the power outlet housed with electricity and the appliance connected to it act as the microservices. The lamp only works when connected to a source of electricity.

  

To understand microservices and how it differs from an API, it helps to learn about what came before it, the monolith architecture.

### Monolith Architecture vs. Microservice Architecture

A monolith architecture style is the predecessor to the alternative microservice architecture style. Formerly, software programs were built in one piece, and components within the program were all interconnected or dependent on one another. This started to become a problem for companies that were quickly growing very large, like Netflix and Amazon.

  

Let’s look at an eCommerce app to understand the main difference. With a monolith architecture, all functions are grouped and, by nature, have to use the same server, language, platform, and the like.

On the other hand, a microservice architecture breaks a feature (or application) into task level services. This means that instead of **one** big shopping cart service with many functions, there would be **multiple** functions instead (e.g., a billing service, shipping options service, tax calculation service). ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RrsZz_DUU1OULoLO2_SE_BdKEzPVficqbGRugHgjtGFhtNn0i8BhYSkguzR3cDpny4trzO_A4lf_r2sV2BPNK9duC12wYEYV1WKEnQOji7_7Sa6FZMQHLAGRbXZJOLjmJSu2Rz6u)

  

Essentially, developers can break down the functionality of a monolith into smaller services that run independently from each other. This allows massive opportunities for an application to scale, which is perhaps the most significant advantage microservice applications have over monolithic applications. However, there are many more advantages to it as follows:

  

Comparing architecture styles: Monoliths vs. Microservices

-   **Language dependency**: With monolithic applications, you’re affected by decisions made in the past. For example, if the application was written in Python, future components must also be written in Python. It doesn’t matter with microservices because each individual service can now communicate through REST APIs instead of a common language.
    
-   **New hire friendliness**: With monolithic applications, developers must have context of all services if they want to make changes to monoliths safely. With microservices, new developers only have to learn the context of the specific, independent service, not the entire application. This allows new members to train for shorter periods before getting their hands dirty.
    
-   **Remote work friendliness**: With microservices, each service is independent, so different services within one application can be worked on simultaneously and deployed separately. Developers don’t have to work on the same repository (nor even in the same country). This makes it especially useful for larger companies because it allows them to form teams to work on separate items without continually going back and forth.
    
-   **Documentation**: Documentation is more critical with microservices because if something goes wrong, it can be tough to determine where, if there isn’t good documentation.
    
-   **Change friendliness**: When a company builds software with a large single codebase, even small changes in the system require an entire build and release process for the entire codebase. Introducing changes to monolithic applications like this is a tedious process, which is why updates to this type of software system are more spaced out (often only a few times per year). With microservices, new services can be tested easily and individually with less chance of disruption. This makes it easier and faster to push out changes and make forward progress.
    
-   **Traffic spike responsiveness**: Let’s look at Netflix. If they had a monolithic architecture, they’d have to adjust to holiday traffic spikes by scaling up the entire application, even functions of the app that are not in high demand (like the DVD returns function). With microservices, they can instead just scale up the specific functions that are in high demand (like the browse function and DVD checkout function).
    

  

Organizations wouldn’t be using their budget efficiently by scaling functions that don’t need to be scaled. Microservices allow them to scale up and down as they see fit.

  

Although microservices have many benefits, It’s important to stress that they're not exactly better than monoliths, as many people falsely believe. It’s just an alternative. Both offer advantages and disadvantages, depending on your specific situation.

## Relationship between microservices and REST API

Now that we know more about microservices and how it differs from a monolith, let’s now address the initial query: how do microservices differ from APIs?

  

Each component within the microservice architecture will have its own API that it uses to communicate with other components. The APIs that connect components within an application to each other serve a different purpose than the APIs you leverage to solve both you and your customer's business problems, which we’ll briefly touch on next.

  

Microservices enable APIs. It’s similar to how a server and software enable a website. A microservice is what makes an API accessible to people. It hosts the API service and makes the security around it work so only authorized users can access the data or resources they are allowed to.

  

In other words, when the API that’s built on the microservice gets exposed, developers and users can now access and leverage the API’s data for their own goals. This allows API providers to monetize their hard work while also helping their internal team and partners for future projects.

### Conclusion: Microservices and APIs

Microservices and APIs will continue to play a massive role in software development leading into 2021. They’re concepts that are transforming enterprise software solutions. Any organization looking to harness digital capabilities within their [whole business process](https://www.ampersandtech.com/services/business-process) should know the distinction between the two concepts.

  

They both offer a ton of benefits and by confusing the two, you’d be blind to just how powerful these two concepts are. However, as stated earlier, just because microservices seem to be the hype nowadays doesn’t mean it’s right for every business. A shift to microservices requires a major cultural shift and robust monitoring for you to see why microservices are all the hype today.
